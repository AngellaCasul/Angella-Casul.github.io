    <h1>Data Privacy and Awareness Campaign Reflection</h1>
    <h3>By: Angella Shaolla G. Casul</h3>
    <p>Data privacy is a big deal in our digital world, and it's something we all need to think about. Every time we share personal information online, we're taking a risk. 
        <br>It's important to be mindful of what we’re posting and who we’re sharing it with. We often trust tech companies to protect our data, but recent breaches remind us that this trust can be misplaced. Realizing that our data is valuable makes us reconsider how much we share. Laws about data privacy vary, so understanding our rights is key, and it’s also crucial to talk about the ethical side of data collection. 
        <br>Ultimately, we need to look out for ourselves and support stronger privacy protections together. By being aware and proactive, we can help create a safer online space for everyone.</p>
